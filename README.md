Welcome to the **fifth problem** of the React 30+ Practical Problems series! In this challenge, we will create a basic toggle switch component.

### Problem 5: Toggle Switch Component 🔄

Build a React application with a `ToggleSwitch` component to demonstrate toggling functionality.

**📝 Problem Description**

Create a React application that features a `ToggleSwitch` component. The component should include a checkbox input that acts as a toggle switch. When toggled, the state of the switch should change, and a label should display either "On" or "Off" based on the state. This challenge will help you practice using React's `useState` hook and handling events.
